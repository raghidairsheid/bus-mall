# Bus Mall
### Youâ€™ve been hired by a startup called BusMall, whose product is similar to the SkyMall catalog found in the seatback pockets on airplanes: a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel. The difference with BusMall is that instead of their catalog being placed in airplanes, they are placed on local busses while commuting through traffic.
